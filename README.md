# Authentification
React Native App where I tested the authentification with firebase. 
I create a few reusable components,  and used a lot of firebase methods, to check if the user is logged. 
Based on the status of my user, components are changing.

If you didn't enter the right username or password you are getting the AUTHENTICATION FAILED message.
If you logged in successfully you get the LOG OUT button.
